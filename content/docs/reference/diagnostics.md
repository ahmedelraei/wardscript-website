# Diagnostics

Every diagnostic has a stable code like `W0107`. A code's meaning never changes
once assigned, and retired codes are never reused, so it's safe to search for
them or mention them in comments.

Errors stop the build; *warnings* don't. The compiler reports every independent
error in a file rather than stopping at the first one. If a file has syntax
errors, name and type checking are skipped, since those errors would mostly be
echoes.

Use this page to look up a code you've run into. Every error message also
explains itself and, where it can, suggests a fix.

## W00xx: syntax

| Code | Meaning |
|---|---|
| W0001 | unexpected character |

| W0010 | expected a specific token (also: keyword used as a name) |
| W0011 | expected an item (`fn`, `type`, `enum`, `import`) |
| W0012 | expected an expression |
| W0013 | expected a type |
| W0014 | expected a pattern |
| W0015 | statement doesn't end: two statements on one line without `;` |
| W0016 | `ai fn` body is not a single prompt string |
| W0017 | `ai fn` has no return type |
| W0018 | duplicate `uses` or `budget` clause |

| W0022 | string interpolation where it isn't allowed (import sources, patterns) |
| W0023 | `pub` on an import |
| W0024 | annotation on something other than a function or import |

## W010x: names and modules

| Code | Meaning |
|---|---|
| W0100 | unknown name in value position (with a "did you mean" suggestion) |
| W0101 | unknown type (also: unknown record in a record literal) |
| W0102 | imported module not found |
| W0103 | name defined more than once (items, parameters, fields, variants, pattern bindings) |
| W0104 | item of another module isn't `pub` |
| W0105 | no such member: enum variant or module item |
| W0106 | wrong kind of name: a type used as a value, or a value used as a type |
| W0107 | untrusted data reaches a sensitive action: a tool argument, or anything declared `Trusted` ([Trust](../language/trust.md)); labels show the path, numbered |

## W011x-W012x: types

| Code | Meaning |
|---|---|
| W0110 | mismatched types |
| W0111 | no such field |
| W0112 | wrong number of type arguments |
| W0113 | record literal is missing fields |
| W0114 | record literal sets a field twice |
| W0115 | wrong number of arguments (calls, variant constructors and variant patterns) |
| W0116 | calling something that isn't a function |
| W0117 | non-exhaustive `match` (names a value that isn't covered) |
| W0118 | `?` on something that can't throw |
| W0119 | operator or `for`/index applied to a type that doesn't support it |
| W0120 | `ai fn` return type has no JSON schema |
| W0121 | type can't be inferred; annotation needed |
| W0122 | no such method |
| W0123 | `validate` rule isn't a function `fn(T) -> Bool` |
| W0124 | function, variant with fields, builtin or namespace used as a value without calling it |
| W0125 | type alias refers to itself |
| W0126 | assignment to something that isn't a variable, field or list element |
| W0127 | *warning*: unreachable `match` arm |
| W0128 | call to a function that `throws`, without `?` |
| W0129 | thrown error is neither caught by a `try` nor declared with `throws` |
| W0130 | `ai fn` declares `throws` |
| W0131 | *warning*: nothing in a `try` block can throw |
| W0132 | a refinement uses something other than `it`, literals, operators, fields, methods and enum variants |
| W0133 | a refinement where it isn't allowed: only record fields, variant payloads, type aliases and `ai fn` return types |
| W0134 | `check` clause on a function that isn't an `ai fn` |

## W014x: classes

See [Classes](../language/classes.md).

| Code | Meaning |
|---|---|
| W0140 | invalid supertype: not a class or interface, a class that isn't `open` or abstract, a base class not written first, an interface extending a class, or a cycle |
| W0141 | invalid override: missing `override`, nothing to override, base method not `open`, or a different signature or visibility |
| W0142 | private field, method or `init` used outside the methods of its class and subclasses |
| W0143 | a field that `init` doesn't set, or a class with fields but no `init` |
| W0144 | `super` misused: outside a subclass's method, called directly, or `super.init(...)` missing from the start of a subclass's `init` or used elsewhere |
| W0145 | invalid class: generic, a method named `init`, `init` with a return type or in an interface, `init` called on an object, fields in an interface, an abstract method outside an abstract class, with a body, or declared `ai fn` |
| W0146 | a class that can be created doesn't implement every abstract method it inherits |
| W0147 | creating an object of an abstract class or an interface |

## W02xx: effects, budgets, Rule of Two

See [Effects and budgets](../language/effects.md).

| Code | Meaning |
|---|---|
| W0200 | a function uses an effect it doesn't declare, directly or through a callee |
| W0201 | *warning*: declared effect is never used, or `llm` declared on an `ai fn` |
| W0202 | unknown effect: not `llm`, an imported tool or one of its functions |
| W0210 | invalid budget: unknown name, not a non-negative number literal, or set twice |
| W0211 | budget is always exceeded: the function makes more model calls on every run |
| W0212 | *warning*: a callee's budget is larger than its caller's |
| W0220 | Rule of Two: untrusted input, private reads and external changes in one function |
| W0221 | invalid annotation, or `@allow` without a reason |
| W0222 | *warning*: `@allow(rule_of_two)` on a function that doesn't need it |
| W0230 | invalid `model` clause: unknown setting, wrong kind of value, a setting or model listed twice |
| W0231 | `model` clause on a function that isn't an `ai fn` |

## W03xx: tools

See [Tools](../language/tools.md).

| Code | Meaning |
|---|---|
| W0300 | `ward.lock` can't be read: invalid JSON, an unknown version, or a malformed tool |
| W0301 | *warning*: a tool import's source isn't in `ward.lock`, so its calls aren't typed |
